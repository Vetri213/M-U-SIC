# M-U-SIC

M-U-SIC is an application that utilizes Tensorflow, OpenCV, Pygame, Tkinter and FER to analyze your facial expression and determine your emotion to play music accordingly. Feel happy? Enjoy the jolly beats. Feeling down? We've got the perfect sad vibes for you! Whatever you're feeling, we have the music for you!

M-U-SIC also enables users to switch tracks (switch to their next dominant emotion), re-analyze their emotions, as well as pause/play.

## Try it out!!
